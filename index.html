He divided Dal Khalsa into two sections: The Budha Dal-army of the veterans and the Tarna Dal - army of the young. He was known for his high character and commanded great respect of all Sikhs. In 1733 A.D., the Mughal government at the time of Zakariya Khan offered an estate and title of Nawab to the Sikhs. The Sarbat Khalsa decided to give the title of Nawab to Kapur Singh. Kapur Singh showed extreme humility and agreed to accept the title after touching to the feet of Panj Piara's (five beloved ones) with the condition that he would continue to serve the community as an ordinary Sikh.";

He was appointed as Commander-In-Chief of the Khalsa army and extended the frontier of the Sikh empire up to the Khyber Pass. He is the only commander in the history, who defeated Afghans in their own backyard. On April 30, 1837 in the battle of Jamrud, he received four gun-shot and continued to lead his troops, until he received another gunshot. Mustering his failing strength, he managed to reach his tent.
